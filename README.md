## Tasks Details

### TASK 1

1. Here are some encoded strings that we need to decode either using online decoder or with the help of any programming language, personally I am trying to solve these strings using python.

	1. ***Ceaser Cypher*** : Dlsjvtl av ulazxbhyl
		
		Explanation: We don't have any `shift key` available to decode this string, in one of the online decoders I've seen that they are using 7 as the default shift key value, but here's a twist, we will find out what's the correct `shift key` and what's the correct decoded version of this string.
